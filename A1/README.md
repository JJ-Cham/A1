Reflection on your experience with this assignment:
        I realized that giving myself a day to proccess the instructions helped a lot because I wasn't as overwhelmed. 
        And looking through the slides again helped with visualization. 
        I actually enjoyed doing the assignment because sometimes it is very hard for me to make the connection between what is taught and how to complete the assignment. The implementation portion was difficult because I wasn't really sure where to go at first. Since, we are trying to designbehavior that is similar to what an Arraylist already does for us. It was particualrlyt difficult with testing and implmenting because I had so many bugs that it became overwhelming. I believe this is the longest assignment, I've done in this amount of time.
